# PART-A: Implement the following using C++/Java/Python
1.Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques.<br><br>
2. Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).<br><br>
3.Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using 
bellman-ford algorithm.<br><br>
4.Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the 
client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents 
of the requested file if present<br><br>
5.Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the 
messages on client side, typed at the server side<br><br>
6.Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the 
data<br><br>
7.Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm 
and token bucket algorithm<br><br>
8.Write a program to implement random early detection (RED) 
congestion control algorithm.<br><br>

# PART-B: Simulation Experiments using NS2/ NS3/ NetSim or any other suitable simulation software.
<br>
9.Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex 
links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find 
the number of packets dropped<br>
b. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a 
network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets 
dropped due to congestion
<br><br>
10.a. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic 
nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.<br>
b. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less 
LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to 
transmission of packets
<br><br>
11.a. Implement and study the performance of GSM on NS2/NS3 
(Using MAC layer) or equivalent environment<br>
b. Implement and study the performance of CDMA on NS2/NS3 
(Using stack called Call net) or equivalent environment.
